# shinra

A Rust + wgpu game engine where games are **runtime-loaded `.so` plugins**. The
engine binary never recompiles when a game changes — drop a new `libgameN.so`
into `target/debug/` and it shows up on the next swipe.

We call the architecture **gametok**: TikTok-style swipe between games. Press
`n` and the current `.so` is unloaded, the next one loaded.

```
.hom (game DSL)              ┐
   │ homunc                  │  per-game artifact
   ▼                         │  (rebuilt only when the game changes)
generated .rs                │
   │ rustc cdylib            │
   ▼                         │
libgameN.so   ←  exports `tick(dt, input)` + `drawables_ptr()`  ┘

shinra runner  ←  stable wgpu + wgsl + viuer/window core
   ├─ scans target/debug for libgame*.so
   ├─ dlopen one game at a time
   ├─ Keymap → InputFrame → tick(dt, &input)
   ├─ pulls drawables, builds a Scene, renders
   └─ `n` → drop(lib), load next
```

See [`design.md`](design.md) for the architecture rationale.

## Run

```bash
cargo build                        # builds engine, runner, both games
cargo run -p runner                # cycles libgame*.so in target/debug
```

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| W A S D | move object (XZ plane) |
| ← → ↑ ↓ | rotate object (yaw / pitch) |
| j / k | enlarge / shrink |
| **n** | **swipe to next game** (drops `.so`, loads next) |
| q / Esc | quit |

`n` is consumed by shinra — games never see it. All other keys are passed in
as a semantic [`InputFrame`](abi/src/lib.rs) so games don't deal with raw key
codes.

## Creating a mini-game

A game is a Rust **cdylib** that exports the [gametok FFI](abi/src/lib.rs).
You can write the gameplay in either:

- **`.hom`** — Homun DSL, compiled by `homunc` to Rust at build time. Ergonomic
  for ECS-style game logic (this is what `game1` and `game2` use).
- **Pure Rust** — direct `hecs::World` + plain functions. More boilerplate;
  useful when you need crate dependencies the DSL doesn't expose.

The fastest path is to copy `games/game1/`, rename, swap the mesh, tweak
`main.hom`. Concrete steps:

### 1. Drop in the `homunc` compiler (one-time, only if writing `.hom`)

Download the latest `homunc` Linux x86_64 binary from
[homun-lang/homun releases](https://github.com/homun-lang/homun/releases) and
place it at `.tmp/homunc`:

```bash
mkdir -p .tmp
curl -L https://github.com/homun-lang/homun/releases/latest/download/homunc-linux-x86_64 \
  -o .tmp/homunc
chmod +x .tmp/homunc
```

`build.rs` will find it automatically.

### 2. Scaffold the new game

```bash
cp -r games/game1 games/game3
sed -i 's/name = "game1"/name = "game3"/' games/game3/Cargo.toml
```

Add the new crate to the workspace in the root `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[workspace]
members = ["engine", "abi", "runner", "games/game1", "games/game2", "games/game3"]
```

### 3. Tell it which mesh to load

Edit `games/game3/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
const MESH_PATHS: &[&str] = &["assets/your_mesh.obj"];
```

Drop the `.obj` file into `assets/`. Multi-mesh games declare more paths;
each `Drawable.mesh_id` indexes this slice.

### 4. Write the gameplay (`games/game3/src/main.hom`)

The contract: `main_tick(dt, input)` runs once per frame. Use `hom_hecs`
helpers (`spawn1`/`query1`/`query1_mut`) to build and step your hecs World.
After `main_tick` returns, `lib.rs` walks the World and pushes a `Drawable`
per renderable entity into the per-frame buffer the runner reads.

Minimal example — a single object that moves in response to `InputFrame`:

```
use std
use hom_hecs

@derive(Clone, Debug)
Player := struct { x: float, y: float, z: float, yaw: float, pitch: float, scale: float }

main_tick := (dt: float, input: InputFrame) -> _ {
  spawned := false
  query1((p: Player) -> _ { spawned := true })
  if (not spawned) {
    spawn1(Player { x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, yaw: 0.0, pitch: 0.0, scale: 1.0 })
  }

  query1_mut((p: Player) -> Player {
    Player {
      x:     p.x + input.move_x * 2.0 * dt,
      y:     p.y,
      z:     p.z + input.move_z * 2.0 * dt,
      yaw:   p.yaw   + input.rot_yaw   * 1.5 * dt,
      pitch: p.pitch + input.rot_pitch * 1.5 * dt,
      scale: scale_step(p.scale, input.scale_delta, dt),
    }
  })
}
```

`InputFrame` fields are `move_x`, `move_z`, `rot_yaw`, `rot_pitch`,
`scale_delta` — see [`abi/src/lib.rs`](abi/src/lib.rs).

### 5. Build and swipe to it

```bash
cargo build -p game3      # produces target/debug/libgame3.so
cargo run -p runner       # press n until you hit your game
```

The runner is **not rebuilt**. Adding `game4` later? Same flow — runner picks
up new `.so` files in sorted order on next launch. Removing one (`mv
target/debug/libgame3.so /tmp/holdout`) makes it disappear from the swipe
cycle without any code changes.

## The FFI contract

Every game `.so` must export six C symbols. `lib.rs` in the game template
provides all of them; you only ever change `MESH_PATHS` and the body of
`main_tick`.

```rust
extern "C" fn meshes_count() -> u32;                              // how many meshes the game wants loaded
extern "C" fn meshes_path(i: u32, out: *mut u8, cap: u32) -> u32; // utf-8 path written into out
extern "C" fn tick(dt: f32, input: *const InputFrame);            // advance one frame of game state
extern "C" fn drawables_ptr() -> *const Drawable;                 // pointer to this frame's draw list
extern "C" fn drawables_len() -> u32;                             // length of draw list
```

`Drawable { mesh_id, model: [f32; 16] }` — column-major mat4. The runner
copies into a transient `Scene`, calls `engine.render(&scene)`, and presents.

Pointers stay valid until the next `tick`. Each game's `hecs::World` lives in
its own `thread_local!`, so swiping between games is a clean state reset —
nothing leaks across `dlclose`.

## Tests

```bash
cargo test                  # 14 unit + 1 render smoke test
ls target/debug/smoke/      # cube.png teapot.png bunny.png — sanity render outputs
```

## Status

POC complete. The runner cycles `game1` (bunny) and `game2` (teapot) without
recompilation. Out of scope for now: hot-reload via filesystem watcher,
save/restore across swipes, window mode (terminal/viuer only), input event
plumbing for held keys (terminals only deliver press events — each frame
treats keys as one-shot impulses).
